![](/src/images/walker-itself.png?raw=true 'The Wanderer')

This is walk animation demonstration in the WEB browser with pure JavaScript and CSS3 solutions.

There are a few nice examples of both JavaScript and CSS3 usage. Like working with points, angels, pseudo-vectors(Js) and creating transitions, animations, transformations, keyframes(CSS3).

In the `src/scss` you can find some SCSS code also. It was used to generate long, cross-browser CSS3 rules.
